Dependencies
------------

Although technically not a dependency, BEASTling is pretty useless without `BEAST <http://beast2.org>`_ installed.  The config files generated by BEASTling are only compatible with BEAST versions 2.x.y.  They *will not work* with old BEAST 1.x.y installations.

The latest versions of BEAST 2 are dependent upon Java version 1.8, so it's a good idea to update your Java installation before you install BEAST.

Many of the config files generated by BEASTling will make use of features which are not a part of the BEAST core, but rather are implemented in packages.  `Managing packages <http://beast2.org/managing-packages/>`_ is fairly straightforward using the Beauti GUI.  To save headaches, you should install the BEAST_CLASSIC, BEASTlabs and morph-models packages before you do anything with BEASTling to avoid confusion.

Installation methods
--------------------

setup.py
~~~~~~~~

BEASTling is installed using the `setup.py` script in the root of the repository.
Installation will look something like this::

	$ git clone https://github.com/lmaurits/BEASTling.git
	$ cd BEASTling
	$ sudo python ./setup.py install

This will install an executable `beastling`, which should be put somewhere in your default ``PATH``, so you can run it from the command line simply by typing `beastling` and hitting enter.

Everything else

Coming soon!
