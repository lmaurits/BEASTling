Dependencies
------------

BEASTling depends upon `SciPy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_.  For boring technical reasons, it's best if you install SciPy first (if you don't already have it installed) either by using your operating system's package management facility (apt, yum, etc.) or a Python packaging tool like easy_install or pip.

Although technically not a dependency, BEASTling is pretty useless without `BEAST <http://beast2.org>`_ installed.  The config files generated by BEASTling are only compatible with BEAST versions 2.x.y.  The *will not work* with old BEAST 1.x.y installations.

The latest versions of BEAST 2 are dependent upon Java version 1.8, so it's a good idea to update your Java installation before you install BEAST.

Many of the config files generated by BEASTling will make use of features which are not a part of the BEAST core, but rather are implemented in packages.  `Managing packages <http://beast2.org/managing-packages/>`_ is fairly straightforward using the Beauti GUI.  To save headaches, you should install the BEAST_CLASSIC, BEASTlabs and morph-models packages before you do anything with BEASTling to avoid confusion.

Installation methods
--------------------

setup.py
~~~~~~~~

BEASTling is installed using the `setup.py` script in the root of the repository.
Installation will look something like this::

	$ git clone https://github.com/lmaurits/BEASTling.git
	$ cd BEASTling
	$ sudo python ./setup.py install

This will install an executable `beastling`, which should be put somewhere in your default ``PATH``, so you can run it from the command line simply by typing `beastling` and hitting enter.

Everything else
