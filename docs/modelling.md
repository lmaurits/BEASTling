# Modelling details

It is important to understand the modelling assumptions made by BEASTling which underly all analyses generated by it.  Substitution models in particular are discussed separately in the next section.

## Tree prior

BEASTling uses a [Yule pure-birth prior](https://beast-mcmc.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/Yule.pdf) for phylogenetic trues.  The birthrate is fixed everywhere on the tree, and is estimated during the analysis.  The prior over birthrates is a uniform prior from zero to infinity.

This model is not particularly suitable for linguistic analyses, however it is currently the best BEAST has to offer.

## Branch lengths

If no calibration points have been provided in the configuration, then the trees logged from a BEASTling analysis will have units of "expected number of mutations for a feature with rate 1.0".

If calibration points have been provided, then branch lengths will be in the same units as the calibrations.

## Clocks

BEASTling currently only supports fixed clock models, i.e. the mutation rate of any particular feature is the same at all points across the tree.
